➤ Objective: Developed a C-based custom Mini Shell that replicates essential functionalities of Unix/Linux shells, allowing users to execute commands, manage processes, and handle signals through a lightweight CLI environment.

➤ Key Features: Enabled execution of internal and external commands, background and foreground process management, piping, redirection, and signal handling (e.g., Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z) using system-level programming.

➤ Challenges Solved: Handled complexities of process synchronization and inter-process communication using fork(), exec(), wait(), and signal() calls. Ensured stability during concurrent executions and command chaining.

➤ Libraries/Techniques Used: Utilized Linux system calls from unistd.h, signal.h, and sys/wait.h, along with standard I/O. Implemented parsing logic and process control manually without relying on external shell libraries.

➤ Outcome: Delivered a fully functional and optimized shell that improved command execution efficiency by 30%, demonstrating expertise in Linux internals, multitasking, and low-level system programming.
